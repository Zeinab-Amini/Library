In this project first it will import psycopg2.
From "teachers" it will "fetch" the first 3 records and will print them.
Then it will insert in the "teacher" some elemts.
Instead of messing with the data from the table, it will update the grades by adding the salary ect.
It will add a list then update it at the end.
